# gpt4-playground
openai playground-like jupyter notebook

This requires access to the OpenAI API.

If you don't have access to the gpt-4 engine you will have to replace it with another engine. (note: for a non-chat-style engine the code may need modification)

In terminal type

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Put in your API key (you can generate them at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in the place that says "your_api_key" in the notebook (or get it from an environment variable), then run the cells and the playground-like widgets should appear.

Note this will charge your account based on your usage, so be familiar with the rates.
